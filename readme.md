# Tic Tac Toe

This is one of the implementations that I made of the famous game Tic Tac Toe.
<br>
In this repo there are 3 different implementations:
```markdown
1. Only backend (main.go): you can play on terminal
2. Only fronted (only_frontend): you can play in your browser (without backend)
3. Site (site): you can play in your browser, running the server to answer your moves (frontend and backend)
```
