# Tic Tac Toe

This is one of the implementations that I made of the famous game Tic Tac Toe.
<br>
In this repo there are 2 different implementations:
```markdown
1. Only backend (program): you can play on terminal
2. Site (site): you can play in your browser, running the server to answer your moves (frontend and backend)
```
